# Luxury Shoes
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This website is built with main focus on the shopping cart. Customers will be able to add, remove and also clear products from the cart with a click of button



<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
Vanilla Javascript with no frame works, html and CSS. The footer was created with bootstrap and font awesome
The website has been deployed twice. The first relied on my local storage area for the products.json which included the APIs and the second was deloyed because local storage was hosted by contentful. </br>
The website is hosted by netflify</br>
